RecipeWizard
RecipeWizard is a machine learning-based intelligent recipe recommendation system that helps users make healthier dietary choices. By analyzing user inputs and nutritional data, the system suggests suitable recipes while considering calorie intake, dietary preferences, and nutritional balance.

Features
Personalized recipe recommendations based on user health profiles

Nutritional filtering for calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates

ML models trained on a curated dataset for food and health

Evaluation and comparison of multiple classification models

User-friendly interface for dietary input and recipe exploration

Machine Learning Models Used
The system evaluates and compares multiple classification models for predicting the healthiness of recipes:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Naive Bayes Classifier

Performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall were used to compare the models and identify the most effective one for recommendation.
